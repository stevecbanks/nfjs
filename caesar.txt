Soliloquy of Marc Antony When He Was All Mad
--------------------------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv-ed in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of myu tongue
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quartered by the hand of war
